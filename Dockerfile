# Dedicated, non-root, minimal image — the same shape as the five sibling
# mocks (boondmanager-mock, entra-mock, linkedin-mock, ga-mock, pennylane-mock).
#
# Runtime dependencies are FastAPI and uvicorn, and nothing else: pagination is
# two integers and the auth is a static bearer, so no crypto library is
# needed. Keeping that true is what keeps the image small and its attack
# surface flat.
#
# `python:3.12-slim` pulled directly rather than through the Harbor proxy:
# this image must ALSO build outside the VPN (dev laptops, GitHub Actions),
# where harbor.build.graal.systems is unreachable. In Tekton CI, kaniko then
# pushes to Harbor, where the pods pull from — the Kyverno
# `only-harbor-images` policy stays satisfied cluster-side.
